    <p>You can ask your precinct captain, party official, or election official
        for any of the following counts.</p>
    <h5>First Count</h5>
    <p>The first count should occur after everyone has been checked in and the caucus doors
        have closed. The party official (or other representative) should instruct all attendees
        to stand in groups based on whom they are supporting.</p>
    <h5>Second Count</h5>
    <p>The second count or ‘re-alignment’ occurs if one of the groups from the first count isn’t
        “viable” (doesn’t have a minimum of 15% support). Supporters in the non-viable group will
        be asked to select another, viable group to support. After everyone is re-aligned, they’ll
        be counted again.</p>
    <h5>Final Count</h5>
    <p>After everyone is in a viable group, a final count will occur and delegates will be
        apportioned. You can get the total number of delegates for your precinct, as well as the
        total number of delegates assigned to each group.</p>
    <p>First, you'll be asked to select your county.
      Then select your polling location, and fill out the following form.</p>
