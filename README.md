## Troubleshooting Local Environment

### Vagrant port forwarding issue "The forwarded port to 5432 is already in use on the host machine."

If you see this error, it's possible you've already got postgres (the database) already running on your machine. If you're on a 'nix system, try entering `sudo service --status-all` at the command line. If you see something that looks like this `[ + ]  postgresql` in the output, stop the service by entering `sudo service postgresql stop` and attempt to bring up vagrant again.
